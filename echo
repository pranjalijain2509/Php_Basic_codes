//there are two basic ways to get output: echo and print.
//The differences are small: 
//echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.
//echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
//echo is marginally faster than print.
//The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo or echo().
