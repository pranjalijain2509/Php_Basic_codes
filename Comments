//A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.
//Comments can be used to:
// Let others understand your code
// Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code

// This is a single-line comment
# This is also a single-line comment
echo "This is a single-line comment";

Output-
This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple
lines*/

echo "<br>";

// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;
echo $x;

Output-
10
